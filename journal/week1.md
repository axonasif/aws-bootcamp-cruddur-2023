### Spending Considerations




## Stretch Homework

### Added steps to update Gitpod environment

I noticed during the prep phase that NPM complained about being out of date:

From running ```lsb_release -a``` I also found we are running Ubuntu Focal 20.04.  I ran an ```apt update && apt -y upgrade``` and noticed a lot of packages needing upgrades, so I decided to automate the updates so it would be handled anytime a new Gitpod workspace spins up.  I thought about switching the image to a newer major version, but apparently the default [Workspace image](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image) is configured fairly specifically, and I don't want to set up a full build from scratch each time I launch a new workspace.  I added the following to the .gitpod.yml init section:

```
      sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
      sudo apt autoremove -y    
      npm install -g npm@latest      
```

### Automated Gitpod environment setup for local container testing

As part of the setup to get the app to run locally in Python, we needed to ensure all the modules in requirements.txt are installed, as well as do an npm install before building the container, so it can copy the contents of node_modules.
Added the following to the .gitpod.yml init section to automate these steps whenever a new Gitpod workspace is spun up:

```
      cd /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/backend-flask
      pip3 install -r requirements.txt
      cd /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/frontend-react-js
      npm i
      cd /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/     
```
