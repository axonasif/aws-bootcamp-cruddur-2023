## Required Homework

1. Attended Week 0 Live Stream, and the Discord Q&A Session afterwards.
* Watched follow-up Week 0 -  Generate Credentials, AWS CLI, Budget and Billing Alarm via CLI video.

2. Watched Chirag's Week 0 - Spend Considerations Video.

  * I had previously set up an AWS Organization and created the Bootcamp account as a subaccount.  I published [an article](https://www.linuxtek.ca/2023/02/07/aws-cloud-project-boot-camp-week-0-tips-and-tricks/) on this.
  * Activated MFA for root user.
  * Reviewed [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/changes-to-aws-billing-cost-management-and-account-consoles-permissions/) for changes to IAM Policies.  Confirmed no affected policies to update.
