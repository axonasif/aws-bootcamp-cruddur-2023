# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture



## Prerequisites
* Created AWS Account for Bootcamp.
* Created Github repo (which you are reading from).
* Set up Gitpod account authorized with Github.  Followed [Gifted Lane's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh9kz9Sh1T8) for setup, and [Andrew Brown's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_c-hJmehs) for the Gitpod button.



## Required Homework

1. Attended Week 0 Live Stream, and the Discord Q&A Session afterwards.
* Watched follow-up Week 0 -  Generate Credentials, AWS CLI, Budget and Billing Alarm via CLI video.

2. Watched Chirag's Week 0 - Spend Considerations Video.

3. Watched Ashish's Week 0 - Security Considerations Video.
  * I had previously set up an AWS Organization and created the Bootcamp account as a subaccount.  I published [an article](https://www.linuxtek.ca/2023/02/07/aws-cloud-project-boot-camp-week-0-tips-and-tricks/) on this.
  * Activated MFA for root user.
  * Reviewed [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/changes-to-aws-billing-cost-management-and-account-consoles-permissions/) for changes to IAM Policies.  Confirmed no affected policies to update.

4.  Created Conceptual Diagram in Lucid Charts AND on a Napkin (for fun)
* So I found this [napkin diagram](../_docs/assets/week0/InvestorNapkinConcept.png) in a bar downtown.  It might have been left by one of the company executives... I think he doodled a bit on it after his meeting.
* [Cruddur Conceptual Diagram Image](../_docs/assets/week0/CruddurConceptualDiagram.png).
* [Link to Lucid.app Diagram Page](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/7b1529ce-a0a8-4286-9c06-b24db24e74b2/edit?viewport_loc=-709%2C-185%2C3072%2C1563%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_00523f1f-f0cb-42a0-9222-c5c55ec7500b).

5.  Finished architectural diagrams:
* [Cruddur Logical Architectural Diagram](../_docs/assets/week0/CruddurLogicalDiagram.png).  
* [Link to Lucid.app Diagram](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/7c5f8bda-7f82-4968-a9fa-9c824462d257/edit?viewport_loc=507%2C60%2C3072%2C1563%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_b5f72136-14bb-482f-9478-a8d4f15e3e20).
* Interesting to pull out the SVG file and have to edit it to get the color fill to work as per the video.  I actually did this, and got the exact color #25392B added.  

6.  Created IAM Admin user with [unique login](https://linuxtekbootcamp.signin.aws.amazon.com/console) alias.  I use a [hosted Bitwarden server](https://www.linuxtek.ca/2023/01/03/self-hosting-bitwarden-on-aws/) to save all my passwords, and it includes a random password generator.

7.  Used AWS CloudShell in ca-central-1 region.  Yup, it works.

8.  Generated AWS Credentials - Access Key/Secret pair for cruddur-admin user.  Added persistent Gitpod variables to store AWS credentials for resuse using these commands:

```
gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
gp env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
gp env AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=""
```

9.  Installed AWS CLI for Gitpod using [this video](https://youtu.be/OdUnNuKylHg).  Manually installed, but also edited .gitpod.yml to auto-install if the environment gets restarted.

```
tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
    env:
      AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
    init: |
      cd /workspace
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
      cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
```

Confirmed in Gitpod [User Settings > Variables](https://gitpod.io/user/variables) that variables are saved:

Started up a new Gitpod environment to confirm AWS CLI was installed correctly and AWS credentials were pulled from Gitpod variables to environment variables.  Successfully ran ```aws sts get-caller-identity``` and returned values.
